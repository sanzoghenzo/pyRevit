      Hi @{{ author }}, Try these steps:

      1. Uninstall pyRevit

      2. Delete C:\ProgramData and %AppData%\ pyRevit and pyrevit-master folders
      
      3. Move all Revit addins to a temporary location. Usual addins locations include:
         - %AppData%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins<year>
         - %AppData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins
         - %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins<year>
         - %ProgramData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins

      4. [Reboot computer]
      
      5. Reinstall pyRevit
      
      6. Started each version of Revit confirming pyRevit successfully compiled at startup.
      
      7. Move all Revit addins that were moved in step 3 back to their original location.
         You may want to add them one at a time and start a revit session everytime to figure out which ones are causing the issue.
